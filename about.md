### Nice to meet you

I'm Andrew. I enjoy playing with data and my tool of choice is R. I'm especially interested in how data can inform public policy. Everything on this site is my own and in no way reflects my job as the Director of Data Insights & Analytics at [BulletinHealthcare](http://bulletinhealthcare.com). Before starting at Bulletin, I received my BA from The George Washington University and my Master of Public Administration from American University.

### Contact me

I'm always happy to talk data.
