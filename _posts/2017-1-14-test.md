## Hello world!
 
This is the first post to my new site hosted by Github Pages. It took a few hours of Googling to figure out how to get all the pieces working, but now I'm able to work in .Rmd files in Rstudio, process them using an R functin, and push the results to the Internet. Look for occassional posts about my side projects here.
